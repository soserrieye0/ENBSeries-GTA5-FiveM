## ENBSeries v0.492

ENBSeries graphic modifications and patches are different.
Patch is fixing specific bugs in the game it was developed for, but some of my patches work with other games, because frequently game developers do the same mistakes. For example, patches for Silent Hill Homecoming, Deus Ex Human Revolution and TES Skyrim may help to reduce lags, stuttering, crashes, bsods, increase performance, fix strange bugs on single core cpu systems.
Graphic modifications do not have patch code in most cases, unless specified in documentation, they are changing graphic effects of the games and adding new effects, so they are decrease frame rate.
Convertor is special library which translate old graphic technologies to newest supported by ENBSeries, convertor standalone do not add any graphic effect. Some versions of convertor included in graphic mods, check them also if target game won't work properly with convertor you are using. At this moment only direct3d8 to direct3d9 (dx8 to dx9) convertor is done, but i'm still planning to create versions for dx5,6,7 and opengl. Convertors to dx10 or d11 are useless, because graphic modifications not existing for them.
